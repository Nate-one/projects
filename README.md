# Python Project Collection

A sample of some of my old Python programming scripts. A lot of the content here is missing dependencies and some files are 
condensed into one. Primarily for demonstration purposes.

## Cowrie_Splunk_JSON_Parsing.py 
### Regex, JSON, APIs, Requests
>**A file of procedural functions to parse JSON output from a Cowrie honeypot with regular expression.**
**Also contains some other random functions related to mapping IPs to countries using the ipinfo.io API .**

## Flask_Web_App.py 
### Flask, SQLite3, Argon2, Jinja2, Regex
>**A Flask Web Application I made in 2020 to primarily focus on security and backend functionality.**

## Manual_PCAP_File_Parsing.py
>**To learn about the file structure of pcapng files I made a simple script to read the first section header block (SHB)**

## MQTT_Networking_&_Postgres.py
### paho.MQTT.client, psycopg2, re, C programming
>**A small side project using an arduino microcontroller progammed in C to measure temperature, humidity, CO2 and other**
**organic compounds (VOC). Data recieve was stored within a PostgreSQL database**

## Pokemon_Price_Comparison.py
### Selenium, bs4, Requests, Pickle, Regex, 
>**A project I undertook was to scrape and parse data of Pokemon cards for sale on Ebay and then compare it to the**
**sale price of the cards on a website known as TCGplayer via their API. Whilst it theoretically did work flawlessly,**
**inconsistencies in ebay listings for the specifications of the cards made false positives widespread.**

## Regex_Injectable_URL_Scanner.py
### Urllib, Regex, bs4
>**A simple script that would extract all the URLs from a web page and determine if they are potentially injectable**
**via regular expression.**
